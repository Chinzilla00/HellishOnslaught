Given time, all terraria playthrough's are the same... Boss Rush after Boss Rush without an end to the Hellish Onslaught. What if something were to change? What if in a world that's never different had something to make everyone see you as a hero or a villain. What if you crossed a parallel dimension and you were brought upon a new world and saw everything you knew was different? They had clans, trading, wars, and something they all feared in common. Could you be their hero? or their villain. Enjoy your stay in a world where Hellish Onslaught is more then a common thing.
